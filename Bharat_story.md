# The Amazing Story of Bharatanatyam
## A Dance That Traveled Through Time

# Chapter 1: What is Bharatanatyam?

Have you ever watched someone dance so beautifully that you couldn't take your eyes off them? That's what happens when you watch Bharatanatyam! It is one of the oldest and most beautiful classical dances in the whole world.It is an Indian classical dance . This special dance comes from a state in India called Tamil Nadu, especially from a city called Thanjavur.

But wait, what does the name "Bharatanatyam" even mean? Well, there are two cool ways to understand it!

The first way is pretty simple. "Bharat" means India, and "Natyam" means dance. So Bharatanatyam means "The Dance of India." 

The second way to understand the name is even more interesting. The word "Bharata" comes from three words put together:
- **Bha** comes from "Bhava" which means feelings and emotions
- **Ra** comes from "Raga" which means the tune or melody of the music
- **Ta** comes from "Tala" which means the beat or rhythm .
  Many people call this dance form differently some of them are :
- Bharatnatyam , Bharataanatyam etc .
So when you put them all together, Bharatanatyam is a dance that combines feelings, music, and rhythm! Isn't that super cool?

What makes Bharatanatyam really special is that it uses every single part of your body when you dance. Your eyes tell a story, your hands make beautiful shapes called mudras, your feet make amazing sounds, and your face shows different emotions. It's like your whole body becomes a talking, singing, dancing machine!

There are three main parts to Bharatanatyam:
1. **Nritta** - This is pure dance where you just move to the rhythm. It's like when you tap your feet to your favorite song!
2. **Nritya** - This is expressive dance where you show emotions and tell stories without using words. It's like acting while dancing!
3. **Natya** - This is dramatic dance where you become different characters and act out plays. It's like being in a movie, but you're dancing!

# Chapter 2: The Divine Origins - Where Did It All Begin?

Now, here comes the most exciting part - where did Bharatanatyam come from? Get ready for a story that goes back thousands and thousands of years!

Long, long ago, way before your great-great-great-grandparents were born, the gods themselves used to dance! According to ancient stories, Lord Brahma, who is the creator of the universe, saw how much fun the gods were having with music and dance. He thought, "Humans should also enjoy this wonderful art!"

So Lord Brahma created a very special book called the **Natya Shastra**. This book had everything about dance, drama, and music written in it. But wait, he didn't write it by himself! He took help from other Vedas (holy books). He took words from one, music from another, acting from the third, and emotions from the fourth. He mixed them all together like a magical recipe!

But who would teach this to humans? That's where a very wise sage named **Bharata Muni** comes in. A sage is like a very, very wise teacher who knows lots of things. Brahma taught all the secrets of dance to Bharata Muni.

Bharata Muni was so amazed by what he learned that he wrote down everything in a book. This book, also called the Natya Shastra, became super famous! It had 36 chapters and talked about everything - how to move, how to express feelings, what costumes to wear, how the stage should look, and so much more. Even today, after thousands of years, dancers still follow what Bharata Muni wrote!

Now, here's another cool story. Have you heard of Lord Shiva? He is known as the "Nataraja" which means the "King of Dance." There's a beautiful statue you might have seen where Lord Shiva is dancing with one leg up and his hair flying around. That dance is called **Tandava**.

Tandava is a very powerful and energetic dance. When Lord Shiva does Tandava, it's said to be so powerful that it can create the universe and also destroy it! Don't worry though, it's just a story that teaches us how powerful dance can be.

Lord Shiva's wife, Goddess Parvati, also loved to dance. But her dance was very different. It was gentle, soft, and graceful like a flowing river. Her dance is called **Lasya**. While Tandava is like thunder and lightning, Lasya is like a gentle breeze and soft moonlight.

Both Tandava and Lasya became part of Bharatanatyam. That's why when you watch Bharatanatyam, sometimes you see powerful, strong movements, and sometimes you see soft, flowing movements. The dance has both!

# Chapter 3: The Temple Dancers - Devadasis

For a very long time, Bharatanatyam was performed in temples. The dancers were called **Devadasis**, which means "servants of God." These were women who dedicated their whole lives to dance and to serving in the temple.

Devadasis were very special people. From when they were tiny little girls, maybe even younger than you, they would start learning dance. They would wake up early in the morning, practice their steps, learn new songs, and dance in front of the gods in the temple. They believed that through their dance, they were making the gods happy!

The temples in South India, especially in Tamil Nadu, were like big dance schools. The walls of these temples have beautiful carvings of dancers. If you ever visit temples like the Brihadeeswarar Temple in Thanjavur or the Chidambaram Temple, you can see hundreds of dance poses carved in stone! These carvings are like a frozen dance class from a thousand years ago.

The Devadasis also created something very important - the **Adavus**. Adavus are the basic steps of Bharatanatyam. Just like how you learn ABCs before you can read, dancers learn Adavus before they can dance. Some Adavus are:
- **Tatta Adavu** - Where you stamp your feet
- **Natta Adavu** - Where you stretch and move
- **Kuditta Metta Adavu** - Where you jump and stamp

There are more than 100 Adavus! Learning them takes a lot of practice. Dancers practice the same step again and again, sometimes hundreds of times, until they get it perfect. It's like practicing your multiplication tables, but with your feet!

The kings and queens of South India loved Bharatanatyam very much. They would invite dancers to perform in their palaces and give them gifts and prizes. The Maratha kings of Thanjavur were especially famous for supporting this dance. They would hold big dance competitions and festivals. Because of their support, Bharatanatyam became even more beautiful and popular.

# Chapter 4: The Dark Times - When Dance Almost Disappeared

But then, something very sad happened. When the British people came to rule India, many things changed. The British didn't understand Indian culture very well. They thought that temple dancing was not good. They made rules that stopped Devadasis from dancing in temples.

In 1910, a law was passed in the Madras Presidency (that's what Tamil Nadu was called back then) that made it very difficult for the traditional dancers to continue their art. Many people stopped learning Bharatanatyam. The dance that had survived for thousands of years was in danger of disappearing!

Imagine if someone told you that you couldn't play your favorite sport or do your favorite hobby anymore. How sad would you feel? That's how the dancers felt. Many of them had to stop dancing. The beautiful art form was slowly being forgotten.

The temples became quiet. The sound of ankle bells (called Ghungroos) that used to fill the air became silent. The beautiful dance poses carved on temple walls seemed to be crying. It looked like Bharatanatyam would be lost forever.

But wait! This story doesn't end sadly. Because some very brave and smart people decided to fight back and save this beautiful dance. They became superheroes of Bharatanatyam!

# Chapter 5: The Heroes Who Saved Bharatanatyam

Every good story has heroes, right? Our Bharatanatyam story has some amazing heroes who saved this dance from disappearing. Let me tell you about them!

## E. Krishna Iyer - The Lawyer Who Danced

**E. Krishna Iyer** was born on August 9, 1897, in a place called Kallidaikurichi in Tamil Nadu. He grew up to become a lawyer - someone who helps people in courts. But guess what? He loved Bharatanatyam more than anything else!

In those days, people said that only certain people could learn Bharatanatyam, and boys were definitely not supposed to dance! But Krishna Iyer didn't care what people said. He was so passionate about the dance that he would dress up in a saree (yes, like what women wear!) and perform Bharatanatyam on stage!

Can you imagine how brave he was? People laughed at him. They made fun of him. But he kept dancing anyway because he believed that Bharatanatyam was too beautiful to let die. He gave speeches and wrote articles telling people that this dance was precious and everyone should be allowed to learn it.

He also fought for girls to be able to learn Bharatanatyam. In the 1920s and 1930s, there was a big discussion about whether girls from good families should learn this dance. Krishna Iyer said, "Yes! Everyone should learn this beautiful art!" He started the fight that would eventually save Bharatanatyam.

Sadly, Krishna Iyer passed away in 1968, but his bravery made him one of the biggest heroes in the history of Indian dance.

## Rukmini Devi Arundale - The Lady Who Changed Everything

Now, let me tell you about the most famous hero of Bharatanatyam - **Rukmini Devi Arundale**. She was born on February 29, 1904, in Madurai, Tamil Nadu. (Fun fact: February 29 only comes once every four years, so she had a very special birthday!)

When Rukmini Devi was a young girl, she was very interested in spirituality and thinking about life. She got married when she was just 16 years old to a British man named George Arundale. He was much older than her - 42 years old! But he was very kind and supportive.

George and Rukmini Devi loved to travel together. On one of their trips to Australia, something magical happened. They met a very famous Russian ballerina (a ballet dancer) named **Anna Pavlova**. Anna Pavlova was one of the best ballet dancers in the whole world!

When Anna Pavlova saw Rukmini Devi, she saw something special in her. She said, "You have the grace of a dancer! You should learn to dance!" She even offered to teach Rukmini Devi ballet.

Rukmini Devi started learning ballet, but then Anna Pavlova gave her some very important advice. She said, "India has such beautiful dances. Instead of learning our Western dance, why don't you learn your own Indian classical dance?"

These words changed Rukmini Devi's life forever! She came back to India and started learning Bharatanatyam from the traditional teachers. She learned very hard and became an amazing dancer.

But Rukmini Devi did something even more important than just dancing. She made Bharatanatyam respectable again. She took out the parts that people thought were not appropriate and made it pure and beautiful. She designed new costumes that were elegant and colorful. She created new ways of presenting the dance on stage with beautiful lights and decorations.

In 1936, Rukmini Devi and her husband George started a school called **Kalakshetra** in Chennai. The name means "temple of art." This school became the most famous dance school in India! Students from all over the world came to learn Bharatanatyam at Kalakshetra.

Rukmini Devi had a beautiful saying: "The greatness of Bharatanatyam lies not merely in its technique, but in the spiritual idea which it conveys." This means that Bharatanatyam is not just about moving your body correctly - it's about touching people's hearts and souls.

Rukmini Devi also loved animals very much. She fought for animal rights and wanted everyone to be kind to animals. She became a member of the Rajya Sabha (part of India's Parliament) and worked to make laws to protect animals.

Sadly, Rukmini Devi Arundale passed away on February 24, 1986, in Chennai. But her Kalakshetra school is still running today! It is now called "Kalakshetra Foundation" and is recognized as an "Institute of National Importance" by the Indian government. Thousands of dancers have learned at this school and spread Bharatanatyam all over the world.

# Chapter 6: Bharatanatyam Spreads Its Wings

After Rukmini Devi Arundale made Bharatanatyam respectable again, something wonderful started happening. More and more people wanted to learn this beautiful dance!

Dance schools started opening all over Tamil Nadu. Then they spread to other states like Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Kerala. Soon, Bharatanatyam schools opened in North India too - in cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata. The dance that almost disappeared was now more popular than ever!

But the story doesn't stop at India's borders. Bharatanatyam flew across the oceans! When Indian people moved to other countries like America, England, Canada, Malaysia, Singapore, and Australia, they took their love for Bharatanatyam with them.

Today, you can find Bharatanatyam classes in almost every big city in the world! From New York to London, from Sydney to Tokyo, children are learning to stamp their feet and make beautiful hand gestures. How amazing is that? A dance that started in the temples of Tamil Nadu is now being performed in theaters around the whole world!

Many talented dancers helped spread Bharatanatyam globally. Some of them are:

- **Balasaraswati** - She was called "Bala" by her fans and was from a family that had been dancing for many generations. She traveled to America and Europe and showed people there how beautiful Bharatanatyam is.

- **Padma Subrahmanyam** - She is a scholar who studied the ancient sculptures on temple walls. She figured out dance poses from carvings that were thousands of years old! She brought back many forgotten dance movements.

- **Alarmel Valli** - She is known for her grace and expression. She has performed in the most famous theaters in the world.

- **Leela Samson** - She studied at Kalakshetra and later became its director. She has trained many young dancers.

These dancers and many others are like seeds that flew from a tree and planted new trees everywhere they went. Now Bharatanatyam has deep roots in countries all over the world!

# Chapter 7: Who Learns Bharatanatyam Today?

So, who learns Bharatanatyam in today's world? The answer will surprise you - almost anyone can!

**Girls and Boys**

In the old days, mostly girls learned Bharatanatyam. But not anymore! Today, many boys are learning this dance too. Male dancers are becoming more and more famous. They bring their own strength and power to the dance, especially in the Tandava style movements. 

**People of All Ages**

You don't have to be a little kid to start learning Bharatanatyam. Some people start when they are 4 or 5 years old. Others start when they are teenagers. Some even start when they are grown-ups! There are also senior citizens who dance. In Bharatanatyam, age is just a number!

**People from Different Countries**

This is the coolest part! People from countries that are very far from India are learning Bharatanatyam. There are American kids in California learning to do Namaskaram (the greeting pose). There are Japanese students practicing their Adavus. There are French dancers performing in their Arangetram (first solo performance). Bharatanatyam has truly become a world dance!

**How Do People Learn Today?**

In the old days, students had to live with their teacher (called Guru) and learn dance for many years. This system was called "Gurukul." While some schools still follow this tradition, there are many other ways to learn today:

1. **Dance Schools and Academies** - There are thousands of Bharatanatyam schools all over the world. Students go for classes after school, just like you might go for soccer practice or piano lessons.

2. **University Programs** - Many universities in India and other countries have dance departments where you can study Bharatanatyam as a subject and even get a degree in it!

3. **Online Classes** - Especially after COVID-19, many teachers started teaching online. Now you can learn from a famous teacher in Chennai while sitting in your home in Canada!

4. **YouTube and Apps** - There are so many videos online that show you basic steps and dances. Of course, it's best to learn from a real teacher, but these can help you practice.

**The Arangetram - A Special Day**

One of the most special traditions in Bharatanatyam is the **Arangetram**. This word means "ascending the stage." It's like a graduation ceremony for dancers!

After learning for many years (usually 5 to 10 years), a student performs their first full solo concert. This is a big deal! The whole family gets excited. They send out fancy invitations to friends and relatives. The student wears beautiful costumes and jewelry. Live musicians play the music.

The Arangetram usually lasts about 2 to 3 hours. The dancer performs many different items showing all the skills they have learned. At the end, everyone claps and cheers. The dancer touches the feet of their Guru to thank them. It's a day that dancers remember forever!

# Chapter 8: The Future of Bharatanatyam - Young Dancers and New Dreams

So, what does the future look like for Bharatanatyam? Let me tell you - it looks very bright and exciting!

**Young People Love It**

You might think that kids today only want to do hip-hop or K-pop dances, right? Well, many young people are actually very interested in Bharatanatyam! They love how it combines exercise, art, music, and storytelling all in one.

Here's what some young dancers say they love about Bharatanatyam:

- "It makes me feel connected to my culture and history"
- "The costumes are so pretty!"
- "I love telling stories through dance"
- "It's like a workout but way more fun"
- "I feel like I'm doing something really special that not everyone knows about"

Many young dancers are getting millions of views on social media! They post videos of themselves dancing on Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. This is helping more and more young people discover Bharatanatyam.

**New Ideas and Experiments**

While traditional Bharatanatyam will always be treasured, young dancers and choreographers are also trying new things:

- **Fusion Dance** - Some dancers mix Bharatanatyam with other styles like hip-hop, contemporary, or even Western classical. Imagine doing a Bharatanatyam step and then a moonwalk!

- **New Stories** - Traditional Bharatanatyam tells stories from Hindu mythology. But some dancers are now using Bharatanatyam to tell modern stories about things like climate change, women's rights, or world peace.

- **New Music** - Some dancers are performing Bharatanatyam to Western classical music, jazz, or even Bollywood songs!

- **Technology** - Dancers are using cool technology like projection mapping, LED lights, and digital backgrounds to make their performances look like something from a sci-fi movie!

Not everyone agrees with these changes. Some people think we should keep Bharatanatyam exactly as it has always been. Others think it's good to try new things while still respecting the old traditions. What do you think?

**Challenges for the Future**

Even though Bharatanatyam is popular, there are some challenges:

1. **Finding Time** - Students today are very busy with school, homework, and other activities. Finding time to practice dance regularly can be hard.

2. **Patience** - Bharatanatyam takes many years to learn well. In a world where we want everything instantly (like fast food and fast internet!), some kids find it hard to keep practicing for so many years.

3. **Finding Good Teachers** - While there are many Bharatanatyam teachers, finding a really good one who can pass on the true spirit of the dance is important.

4. **Keeping Traditions Alive** - As dance changes and grows, it's important not to forget the old traditions and wisdom that have been passed down for thousands of years.

**The Spirit Lives On**

But despite all these challenges, one thing is for sure - Bharatanatyam is not going anywhere! It has survived for thousands of years, through good times and bad times. It survived when the British tried to stop it. It survived when people said it was old-fashioned. And it will continue to survive because there's something magical about it.

When a dancer stamps their feet and the bells on their ankles ring out, it's like the voice of the past speaking to us. When a dancer's eyes tell a story of love or bravery, it connects us to feelings that all humans share, no matter where they come from.

Rukmini Devi Arundale once said that Bharatanatyam is not just about technique but about spirituality. This spiritual quality is what makes Bharatanatyam special. It's not just exercise. It's not just entertainment. It's a way to connect with something bigger than ourselves.

# The End... Or Just the Beginning?

And so, our story of Bharatanatyam comes to an end. But wait - is it really the end?

Not at all! The story of Bharatanatyam continues with every child who ties their first ankle bells. It continues with every student who practices their Adavus until their legs hurt. It continues with every Arangetram where a young dancer takes their first step onto the big stage.

Maybe you will be part of this story too! Maybe you'll learn Bharatanatyam and become a great dancer. Maybe you'll watch a performance and feel moved by its beauty. Maybe you'll tell your friends about this amazing dance from India.

Bharatanatyam is like a great river that started as a tiny stream in ancient temples thousands of years ago. It has flowed through time, sometimes almost drying up, sometimes flooding with new energy. Today, that river flows through dance studios in Chennai and Chicago, in temples and theaters, in villages and cities all over the world.

The story of Bharatanatyam teaches us many things:
- Beautiful things are worth protecting
- Brave people can save traditions that are dying
- Art belongs to everyone, not just a few people
- Ancient wisdom can still touch our modern hearts
- When people are passionate about something, they can change the world

So the next time you see someone performing Bharatanatyam, remember that you're not just watching a dance. You're watching thousands of years of history, the dreams of countless dancers, the bravery of heroes like E. Krishna Iyer and Rukmini Devi Arundale, and the hopes of young dancers who are carrying this tradition into the future.

And that, my friends, is the amazing, wonderful, never-ending story of Bharatanatyam!
